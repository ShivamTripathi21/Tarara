The objectives of World Music Hackathon are to create solutions that help people with disabilities interpret sound and music, discourage piracy, and connect artists with their audience in real-time or over time. We are hoping these new and creative thoughts and innovations would reliably furnish musicians with motivation and will interface the path in rethinking and reengineering music for the digital age.
